Well, **SoundCloudify** has been taken down from Chrome Webstore because it has **SoundCloud** in its name - this infringe the trademarks of SoundCloud. Now I have to re-publish it to the store under the new name: **UpNext**  - and it looks like 99.99% new :)

The original extension already has more than **25k users** & **250 ratings (average 4.8 stars)**. Please give your support for the new one by leaving your review & rating. It will be a big big motivation for me to move on.
