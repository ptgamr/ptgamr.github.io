###Who am I?
I'm just a front-end developer, who is really passionate about WEB and Mobile development. I come from Vietnam. I speak English and Javascript fluently. I become a FULL-STACK developer when needed. You can sometimes find me dealing with  MongoDB, RESTful Services, or even some deployment scripts.

###Do I love my job?
Yes. Definitely. There's nothing more perfect than doing what you love and it brings you everyday food. I do love my job very much.

###My works?

Before that I was frontend developer at http://coccoc.com, Vietnamese leading search engine and browser. 

A site that i still maintain as a hobby: http://j4f.vn, a funny gif sharing place. It supports uploading, tagging, commenting for images. All done by Javascript: AngularJS, NodeJs, backed by MongoDB.

I'm working on an small game for iOS and Android using IONIC Framework. Here is the link to the game [Hai Nao Game](https://itunes.apple.com/vn/app/hai-nao/id902660856?ls=1&mt=8), this is a Riddle game, question is available in Vietnamese :-)
