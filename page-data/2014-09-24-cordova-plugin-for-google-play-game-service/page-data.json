Only one repository on Github and it says ‘work in-progress’, but i didn’t see any progress at all.</p>\n<p>Decided to write my own plugin. The first time to write a Cordova plugin, i was struggling for two days to make it build successfully in Eclipse.</p>\n<p>You can fork it here: <a href=\"https://github.com/ptgamr/cordova-google-play-game\">https://github.com/ptgamr/cordova-google-play-game</a></p>\n<p>A Game that i developed using this plugin can be found here, download it and play if you like: </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/vn/app/wow-puzzles/id916475017?mt=8\"><img src=\"https://developer.apple.com/app-store/marketing/guidelines/images/badge-download-on-the-app-store.svg\" alt=\"WOW PUZZLES iOS\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.a42.xephinhtuoitho\"><img src=\"https://developer.android.com/images/brand/en_app_rgb_wo_45.png\" alt=\"WOW PUZZLES Android\"></a></p>\n<p>Basically, the Game Service concept is similar between iOS and Android. You’ll have to get familiar with the concept of Leaderboards &#x26; Achivements.</p>\n<h3>Installation</h3>\n<p>To install the plugin, please do the following command in your beloved Terminal:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">cordova plugin add https://github.com/ptgamr/cordova-google-play-game.git --variable APP_ID=711269060910\n  </code></pre></div>\n<p>Please note that you have to specify the APP_ID, which is your clientId while creating the game in Google Play Developer Console. If you want to know how to retrieve your appId, please to this <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/games/services/android/quickstart\">nicely Google’s guide</a></p>\n<p>The plugin will install <code class=\"language-text\">Google Play Services</code> as its dependency. It will modify your MANIFEST file &#x26; res/strings.xml automatically (to add your APP_ID), follow this guide: <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/google/play-services/setup.html\">https://developer.android.com/google/play-services/setup.html</a></p>\n<h3>Note for using together with Cordova Plugin Admob</h3>\n<p>For those who use this Admob plugin: <a href=\"https://github.com/floatinghotpot/cordova-plugin-admob\">https://github.com/floatinghotpot/cordova-plugin-admob</a> together with my plguin, you’ll probaly have the error during installation, because it use the old Admob SDK:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">dependency id=&quot;com.google.admobsdk-ios&quot;</code></pre></div>\n<p>I give it a FORK <a href=\"https://github.com/ptgamr/cordova-plugin-admob\">here</a>, to remove the Admod SDK as the dependency. Please consider use this version together with <code class=\"language-text\">Codova Google Play Game</code></p>\n<p>If you have any question using the plugin, please wrote me a comment, or creat the issue on Github.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Cordova plugin for Google Play Game Service","date":"September 23, 2014","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2014-09-24-cordova-plugin-for-google-play-game-service/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2014-09-13-translate3d-vs-translate-performance/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"CSS3: Translate3d vs Translate performance"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2014-11-14-angularjs-differences-between-the-service-factory-and-provide-methods/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"AngularJS - Differences between the service(), factory(), and provide() methods"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","916993862"]}
