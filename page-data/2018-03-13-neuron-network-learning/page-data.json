This means that you can stack on additional ResNet blocks with little risk of harming training set performance. (There is also some evidence that the ease of learning an identity function—even more than skip connections helping with vanishing gradients—accounts for ResNets’ remarkable performance.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Q: Why is that?
