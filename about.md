<p class="message">
  I am mainly a JavaScript developer but not limited to that, you can find me doing Elixir & DevOps sometimes.
  Not something that super complicated but I love to build web application in general, every part of it - and
  I want to choose the best and yet simple tool for the job.

  <br/>

  Oh, I love building mobile app using React-Native as well. It's bomb!

  <br/>

  I am lucky enough to experienced first with Angular, then with Ember, and now React & React-Native. By far,
  I love all of them and the good thing is they're pretty much heading toward the same direction: Web application
  as a tree of components & data flown down from the top. Thanks a lot to #React which is really a game changer.

  <br/>

  Blessed enough, I want to write up what I've learnt along the way here to share it with you guys. Hopefully
  you'll find it useful in someway. I will try my best to release 1 blog post per week.

  <br/>

  Please head towards to [Ideas](http://trinhtrunganh.com/ideas), I sketch out what I'll write next there.

  <br/>

  See you,
